# donut_shop
Code Fellows week 2 assignment

This is the events branch.

Listen for and handle events:

Imagine a scenario where a user would like add new locations to the table.
-Add input tags for the following location attributes.
Location name
Minimum customers per hour
Maximum customers per hour
Average donuts purchased per customer

Then add a button tag that saves the location in the following manner.

-Creates a new DonutShop object with the user supplied data from the input tags.

-Appends a row to the table using the new object's hourly and daily donut totals.

Once you've figured out how to add a new location, try using the same HTML elements to update an existing location. Here are a few tips to point you in the right direction.

Use an Array to hold an ordered collection of objects
Once you've figured out how to update an existing location, try implementing a few event-based easter eggs.  :)

For this assignment, you're not allowed to the prompt() function or jQuery.
